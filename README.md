# Image Compression, Resampling, and Noise Filtering ðŸ“¸âœ¨

This repository focuses on three essential aspects of image processing: **JPEG compression**, **resampling algorithms**, and **noise filtering** techniques. The project is written in Python and organized into specific folders for clarity.

## Folder Structure:

### 1. JPEG Compression
   - Implements key steps of JPEG compression for a 24bpp image:
     1. Color space conversion
     2. Discrete Cosine Transform
     3. Quantization
     4. Zig-Zag scanning
     5. Run Length and Huffman coding

### 2. Resampling
   - Contains Python scripts for image resampling based on bi-linear interpolation and nearest neighbour methods.

### 3. Noise Filtering
   - Implements various noise filtering algorithms:
     1. Mean filter
     2. Median filter
     3. k-closest averaging
     4. Threshold averaging

## Execution Instructions:

1. Navigate to the respective folders for JPEG compression, resampling, or noise filtering.
2. Execute the Python scripts to apply the desired image processing techniques.
